# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [Olympic Sports and Medals 1896-2014](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games)



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Do host countries of the Olympic Games experience an economic boost, and does that correlate with their performance in the Games?
 * How does a country's GDP or economic size correlate with the number of Olympic medals won?
 * Which countries have won the most gold medals over time?
 * What is the geographic distribution of Olympic medals in the Summer and Winter Games?

## Sketches

A pie chart illustrating the share of gold medals won by various countries, with countries like the USA and USSR leading the chart.

## Prototypes

![Home Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1a5df01-4426-4144-bacb-e50b706d793a)
This will be the Home Page. It's a proof of concept home page of a world map showing the distribution of Olympic medals by country, differentiated by size and highlighting summer and winter games.



## Open Questions


I have some uncertainty about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. One concern is sourcing geographic shape files, like shapefiles or GeoJSON, for accurate medal distribution maps. Additionally, resolving country codes to meaningful names, especially for outdated or former countries, could be challenging. Integrating economic data like GDP or sports spending is also a concern, as finding reliable data and merging it with the Olympic dataset might be difficult.
